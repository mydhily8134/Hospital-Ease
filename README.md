Welcome to the Clinic/Hospital Management System! Our system is designed to efficiently store and manage patient data, as well as handle appointment bookings and cancellations. Here are the key features:

1. Patient Database:
   - The system maintains a comprehensive patient database.
   - Each patient's record includes the following information:
     - Mobile number (primary key)
     - Name
     - Date of Birth
     - Medical History
     - Prescribed Medicines

2. Patient Management:
   - You can easily add new patients to the database, providing all the necessary details.
   - Select and view specific patient records when required.
   - Search for patients based on their mobile number, name, or other criteria.
   - Delete patient records if needed (e.g., upon request or when a patient is discharged).

3. Appointment Management:
   - Our system also handles appointment scheduling and cancellations.
   - Patients can book appointments at their preferred date and time.
   - In case of schedule changes or conflicts, patients can cancel their appointments.
   - You can search for upcoming or past appointments for any patient.
